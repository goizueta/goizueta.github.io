I'm a curious twenty-something currently residing in the East Village neighborhood of NYC. 

*As a worker*, I help create tech products. For the past two years, I worked at [Endless Computers][1] where we built a new computer, operating system, and suite of applications to address the needs of the developing world. There, I fell in love with the peoples and cultures of our customers in countries like Brazil, Guatemala, South Africa, and Jordan. And I became intensely excited about the opportunities to help people in emerging markets with technology.

Some of my other jobs included working with [Natural Language Processing][2] software to analyze emotional content of newspaper publications, building immersive virtual worlds for the [Virtual Human Interaction Lab][3] at Stanford, and creating a website to help people better access mental health resources. 

*As a student*, I studied [Symbolic Systems][4] at Stanford University, where I earned a BS and MS. My concentration was in Human-Computer Interaction and I wrote my thesis on [social presence][5] in virtual environments. In 2014, I participated in the [Mayfield Fellows Program][6].

*As a reader*, I'm a big fan of David Foster Wallace and recently have been on a bit of a metaphysics kick and reading about it from Christian, Taoist, Buddhist, and secular perspectives

*As a hobbyist*, I'm interested in slacklining, fire poi, improv, and lock-picking.

*As a human*, I like to travel to places that are hard to get out of. I split my time between spending time with my family and friends (old and new), and seeking out solitude to journal, meditate, think, and contemplate this crazy, wonderful thing called life.

I'm a constantly-changing twenty-something currently residing in the East Village neighborhood of NYC. 

*As a worker*, I use technology to help people become better versions of themselves. I currently work at [Andela][0] where I help developers in Kenya and Nigeria build meaningful open source projects.

Before that, I worked at [Endless Computers][1] where we built a new computer, operating system, and suite of applications to address the needs of people in places like Brazil, Guatemala, and Jordan. Some of my other jobs included working with Natural Language Processing software to analyze emotional content of newspaper publications, building immersive virtual worlds for the [Virtual Human Interaction Lab][3] at Stanford, and creating a [website][2] to help people better access mental health resources. 

*As a student*, I studied [Symbolic Systems][4] at Stanford University, where I earned a BS and MS. My concentration was in Human-Computer Interaction and I wrote my thesis on [social presence][5] in virtual environments. In 2014, I participated in the [Mayfield Fellows Program][6].

*As a reader*, I'm a big fan of David Foster Wallace and recently have been on a bit of a metaphysics kick and reading about it from Christian, Taoist, Buddhist, and secular perspectives

*As a hobbyist*, I'm interested in slacklining, fire poi, improv, and lock-picking.

*As a human*, I like to travel to places that are hard to get out of. I split my time between spending time with my family and friends (old and new), and seeking out solitude to journal, meditate, think, and contemplate this crazy, wonderful thing called life.
